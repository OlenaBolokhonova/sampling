# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The use of a stratified random sampling strategy, targeting individuals aged 18 and older in Canada, is designed to ensure proportional representation of different age groups. 
    There are several factors that can affect the quality and representativeness of the sample.
    
    1. Sampling Frame:
    - Target population: The survey targets students, faculty, and staff at the University of Toronto, as well as broader community members through social media and local community centers. A 20-year-old student, a 40-year-old faculty member, and a 60-year-old community center attendee are all included in the sampling frame.
    - Potential bias : While this approach increases diversity, it may also introduce bias towards those more engaged in university or online communities, potentially underrepresenting older adults or those less connected to digital platforms.

    2. Self-Selection Bias: Individuals with a strong interest in music are more likely to participate.
    
    - Example: A music forum might attract more participants who are avid music enthusiasts, such as a 30-year-old frequent concert-goer, compared to someone who casually listens to music on the radio.
    - Conclusion: Efforts should be made to encourage participation from a wide range of individuals, not just those passionate about music, to avoid skewing the results.

    3. Access and Digital Divide: Online surveys might exclude older adults or those without internet access:
    - Example: A 70-year-old who rarely uses the internet might be underrepresented in an online survey compared to a 25-year-old who is tech-savvy.
    
    - Conclusion: To mitigate this, the survey could be distributed through in-person events to ensure older adults are adequately represented.

    4. Representativeness:
    - Accurate representation of different age groups is crucial. If the sample includes the proportional representation of participants, for example 50 participants from the each age group, , the analysis can provide insights into how music tastes evolve from young adulthood to senior years.

    Conclusion:
    
    In summary, the quality of the sample is expected to be high due to the use of a stratified random sampling strategy. However, challenges such as self-selection bias and access issues need to be addressed to enhance the representativeness of the sample. By actively working to include a diverse range of participants, both online and offline, the survey results should provide a robust understanding of the relationship between age and music taste among Canadians aged 18 and older.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    Changes and Reasoning:
    
    1. Inclusion of an Ethics Statement:
    
    - Change: Add a statement at the beginning of the survey explaining the purpose of the survey, the voluntary nature of participation, and assurance of confidentiality.
    
    - Reasoning: This ensures that participants are informed about the study's purpose, their rights, and how their data will be used, which is essential for ethical research practices.

    2. Reduction of Leading Questions:
    
    - Change: Modify the question 8 about how technology has impacted music tastes to remove any implied bias.
    Original: "How has technology impacted your music tastes?"
    Revised: "Has technology impacted your music tastes?"
    Reasoning: The original question assumes that technology has had an impact, which could bias responses. The revised question is more neutral.

    3. Identified mistakes in the question 10:

    a. Inconsistent Phrasing: options in the original question used different structures, such as "I often discover" and "I discover," leading to inconsistency.
    
    - Reasoning: Simplified all options for consistent phrasing reduces confusion and improves readability.

    b. Incompleteness: the original question missed common contemporary methods like music recommendation algorithms.
    
    - Reasoning: added "Music recommendation algorithms" to ensure the survey captures all relevant and modern methods of music discovery.

    c. Specificity of Friends' Suggestions: The original option "I often discover new music through my friends' suggestions" is too specific.
    
    - Reasoning: Generalized to "Recommendations from others" to include suggestions from a broader range of sources, not just friends.
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?
